            "ex":"Deep Breathing: Most people take short, shallow breaths into their chest. It can make you feel anxious and zap your energy. With this technique, you'll learn how to take bigger breaths, all the way into your belly. Get comfortable. You can lie on your back in bed or on the floor with a pillow under your head and knees. Or you can sit in a chair with your shoulders, head, and neck supported against the back of the chair. Breathe in through your nose. Let your belly fill with air. Breathe out through your nose. Place one hand on your belly. Place the other hand on your chest. As you breathe in, feel your belly rise. As you breathe out, feel your belly lower. The hand on your belly should move more than the one that's on your chest. Take three more full, deep breaths. Breathe fully into your belly as it rises and falls with your breath."

Breathe in. As you do that, imagine that the air is filled with a sense of peace and calm. Try to feel it throughout your body. Breathe out. While you're doing it, imagine that the air leaves with your stress and tension. Now use a word or phrase with your breath. As you breathe in, say in your mind: I breathe in peace and calm. As you breathe out, say in your mind: I breathe out stress and tension. Continue for 10 to 20 minutes."

Sit comfortably on the floor or in a chair. Breathe in through your nose. As you do it, count to five. Breathe out through your nose to the count of five. Repeat several times. Once you feel comfortable with breaths that last five counts, increase how long you breathe in and breathe out. You can work up to breaths that last up to 10 counts."
