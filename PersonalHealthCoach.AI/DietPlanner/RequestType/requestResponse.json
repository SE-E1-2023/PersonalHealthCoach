      "The rules for this diet are simple. A person needs to decide on and adhere to a 12-hour fasting window every day.",
      "Fasting for 16 hours a day, leaving an eating window of 8 hours, is called the 16:8 method or the Leangains diet.",
      "People following the 5:2 diet eat standard amounts of healthful food for 5 days and reduce calorie intake on the other 2 days.",
      "For some people, alternate day fasting means a complete avoidance of solid foods on fasting days, while other people allow up to 500 calories. On feeding days, people often choose to eat as much as they want.",
      "The Warrior Diet involves eating very little, usually just a few servings of raw fruit and vegetables, during a 20-hourTrusted Source fasting window, then eating one large meal at night. The eating window is usually only around 4 hours."
