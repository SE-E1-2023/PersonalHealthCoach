            "Description": "While mindful walking has no single definition, the goal is clear: to be consciously aware while moving through the environment.  The journey becomes less about the destination and more about an awareness of what is outside and inside us. When moving - perhaps to an even greater degree - it is possible to find stillness, to become aware, and be present. Find somewhere safe to walk where you will not be disturbed: your garden, a city park, country lane, or a busy street and wear comfortable clothing and shoes for walking. Stand still and become aware of how you feel. Consider your posture, the weight of your body, feet in your shoes, and your muscles as you balance. Take a few deep breaths and slowly bring your awareness into the present. Begin walking, a little slower than normal. Maintain awareness of each footstep as it rolls from heel to toe, the muscles and tendons in your feet and legs and the movement and muscles elsewhere in your body. Pay attention to your senses as you walk: Hear the wind blow in the trees, smell the cut grass, feel the light touch of rain on your face, see the car lights reflected on the windows of shops, the shadows moving as you walk Be aware of each breath. Breathe easily, but deeply. When your mind drifts from walking and breathing, gently guide your thoughts back. Continue walking for as long as you feel safe and comfortable. Remember, wherever you walk, whether a bustling street or a windy hillside, there is a myriad of stimuli with which to flood your senses. Become aware; savor the sensations.  When your meditation is at an end, stop and stand still. Take a few deep breaths."

It can feel challenging to some, but it's really no different than vividly recalling the face of an old friend naturally, without effort. And so it is with meditation. By conjuring a specific visualization, we not only get to observe the mind, but we also get to focus on any physical sensations."

Remind yourself that whatever you write is fine, no matter how grammatically incorrect, 'out there', or indecipherable you think it is. A larger journal is handy for this type of journaling, as stream-of-consciousness journaling can take up a whole page very quickly. Turning a page can temporarily get you out of the stream-of-consciousness flow, so the less turned pages, the better."

These are people that lift you higher. Write about what inspired you, how you have taken those principles into your own life.

Think of your ideal place to relax. While it can be any place in the world, real or imaginary, it should be an image that you find very calming, happy, peaceful, and safe. Make sure it's easy enough to think about so you can return to it in your mind when you feel anxious in the future. Think of all the small details you'd find if you were there. Think about how the place would smell, feel, and sound. Envision yourself in that place, enjoying it comfortably. Once you have a good picture of your 'happy place', close your eyes and take slow and regular breaths through your nose and out of your mouth. Be aware of your breathing and continue focusing on the place you've imagined in your mind until you feel your anxiety lifting. Visit this place in your mind whenever you feel anxious."

Sit in a quiet and comfortable place. Close your eyes and focus on your breathing. Breathe slowly into your nose and out of your mouth. Use your hand to make a tight fist. Squeeze your fist tightly. Hold your squeezed fist for a few seconds. Notice all the tension you feel in your hand. Slowly open your fingers and be aware of how you feel. You may notice a feeling of tension leaving your hand. Eventually, your hand will feel lighter and more relaxed. Continue tensing and then releasing various muscle groups in your body, from your hands, legs, shoulders, or feet. You may want to work your way up and down your body tensing various muscle groups. Avoid tensing the muscles in any area of your body where you're injured or in pain, as that may further aggravate your injury."

Sometimes this relief occurs quickly, but other times it might take a while. Stay calm and patient. Counting can relax you because it gives you something to focus on besides your anxiety. It's a great tool to use in a crowded or busy space like a store or train where other anxiety exercises might be more challenging to carry out."
