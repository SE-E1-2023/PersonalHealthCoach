Your feet swell during the day and stop in the late afternoon, so if you need sneakers, you'll want to shop when your feet are biggest. Also, make sure the shoes are a little roomy\u2014enough to wiggle your toes, but no more than that. They should be comfy from the get-go, but they'll be even more so once you've walked or ran 20 to 40 miles in them."

Well, one woman sued the makeup chain Sephora in 2017, claiming she contracted oral herpes from a lipstick tester. And a 2005 study found between 67 and 100 percent of makeup-counter testers were contaminated with bacteria, including E. coli, staph and strep. All those bugs can cause skin and eye infections. Never use a public makeup tester. Ask for a single-use sample that's sealed. If those aren't available, test a new shade on the back of your hand, then wash it off promptly."
