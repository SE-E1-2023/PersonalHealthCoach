        "Tip": "Take vitamin D if you`re deficient. Most people do not get enough vitamin D. While these widespread vitamin D inadequacies are not imminently harmful, maintaining adequate vitamin D levels can help to optimize your health by improving bone strength, reducing symptoms of depression, strengthening your immune system, and lowering your risk for cancer. If you do not spend a lot of time in the sunlight, your vitamin D levels may be low. If you have access, it`s a great idea to have your levels tested, so that you can correct your levels through vitamin D supplementation if necessary."

The ODS also suggest that omega-3 fatty acids can help with inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. They are also plentiful in vitamins A and D. One 2014 study suggested that fatty acids can significantly reduce the risk of rheumatoid arthritis."

Pause 1-2 seconds at the top and return to the starting position. 4. Complete 10-12 reps for 3 sets."
