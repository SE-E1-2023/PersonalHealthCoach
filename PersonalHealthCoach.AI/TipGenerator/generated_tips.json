        "Tip": "Opt for Healthier Snack and Fast-food Options. It's hard to avoid that 3 p.m. stomach rumble. While eating something to hold you over until dinner is fine, some choices may be better than others. As often as possible, try to have some fruit, veggies, or snacks with a lot of protein handy. However, if you find fast food is your only option, pull up the restaurant's nutrition facts online. You can make an informed decision ahead of time about what to order. Nearly every quick-service restaurant has a relatively healthful option or two. Salads, chili, or grilled chicken are all good options."

Lie on your right side with your left leg and foot stacked on top of your right leg and foot. Prop your upper body up by placing your right forearm on the ground and elbow directly under your shoulder. 2. Contract your core to stiffen your spine and lift your hips and knees off the ground, forming a straight line with your body. 3. Return to start in a controlled manner. Repeat 3 sets of 10\u201315 reps on one side, then switch."
