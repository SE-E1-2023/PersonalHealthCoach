When your hands reach the ground, pop your legs straight back into a pushup position. 3. Jump your feet up to your palms by hinging at the waist. Get your feet as close to your hands as you can get, landing them outside your hands if necessary. 4. Stand up straight, bringing your arms above your head, and jump. 5. This is one rep. Complete 3 sets of 10 reps as a beginner."

        "Tip": "Stress and tension. Stress and tension can affect you physically in many ways, including increased muscle tension and chronic contraction. This may be experienced as tension in the eyes, jaw, neck, shoulders, lower back and stomach. Prolonged muscle tension can lead to aches and pains, such as headaches, migraine, backache, muscular spasm and injury. To help reduce stress and physical tension: Learn to recognise the signs of tension in your body. Stop regularly and think about how muscles in your body feel. Identify those muscles that seem most tense when you feel stressed. Regularly practise slow and deep breathing, particularly when you feel tense or stressed. Deep breathing using abdominal muscles is preferable to shallow breathing relying on chest muscles. Learn to take time out to relax - for example, think of pleasant images and listen to music to calm you. Learn a deep muscle relaxation technique, such as progressive muscle relaxation - that is, a method of systematically contracting and relaxing your muscles. See a psychologist for training."

        "Tip": "Immobilize The Injured Part Of The Body. If an injured body part is frequently utilized after an accident, it will have a difficult time healing. Pain is a good sign of a continuing injury, and it should not be disregarded, even if it means taking a break from everyday activities or sports. To facilitate full healing, it is generally essential to immobilize the damaged region using a splint or brace and rest it entirely. Continuing to utilize the damaged body part may exacerbate an acute injury, making it more likely to reoccur and more difficult to cure."
