Choose a moderate-weight dumbbell and ensure that you\u2019re squeezing at the top of the movement. Equipment: 10-pound dumbbells. 1. Start with a dumbbell in each hand. We recommend no more than 10 pounds for beginners. 2. Bend forward at the waist, so your back is at a 45-degree angle to the ground. Be certain not to arch your back. Let your arms hang straight down. Ensure your neck is in line with your back and your core is engaged. 3. Starting with your right arm, bend your elbow and pull the weight straight up toward your chest, making sure to engage your lat and stopping just below your chest. 4.Return to the starting position and repeat with the left arm. This is one rep. Repeat 10 times for 3 sets."

Cycling classes are great fun, an even better workout and are available everywhere. Cycling is a low-impact way to burn a tonne of calories, but it also makes you feel happier and makes your brain perform much better. Our research finds that after only three months, people who exercised had the brain volume of those three years younger."
