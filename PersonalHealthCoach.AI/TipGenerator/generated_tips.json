        "Tip": "Carbs aren`t the enemy. Carbohydrates are considered the new \u201cenemy`` by a lot of people (right there after fats, which were blasted as bad for you not so long ago and they`re starting to get some \u201cgood press`` nowadays). They`re not. They`re actually quite good for you as long as you use them in the right way, and choose the right ones. It`s more important to monitor the amount of calories you`re consuming and ensure you`re in deficit (if you want to lose weight) or that you`re eating a hell of a lot more than you should if your objective is to gain weight/muscle). Myfitnesspal can help you do this and we`ve written about it previously."

        "Tip": "Oily fish. Some examples of oily fish include salmon, trout, mackerel, herring, sardines, and anchovies. These types of fish have oil in their tissues and around their gut. Their lean fillets contain high levels of omega-3 fatty acids. These oils may provide benefits for the heart and nervous system, according to the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS). The ODS also suggest that omega-3 fatty acids can help with inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. They are also plentiful in vitamins A and D. One 2014 study suggested that fatty acids can significantly reduce the risk of rheumatoid arthritis."

Hinging at the hips, begin to kick your left leg straight back behind you, lowering the dumbbell down toward the ground. 3. When you reach a comfortable height with your left leg, slowly return to the starting position in a controlled motion, squeezing your right glute. Ensure that your pelvis stays square to the ground during the movement. 4. Repeat 10 to 12 reps before moving the weight to your left hand and repeating the same steps on the left leg. It`s suggested to do 3 sets of 10-12 reps per side."

So when your doctor prescribes bed rest for a while, it`s because it helps you with the recovery process. Take short walks or work only for an hour or less, if you must. Increase your physical activity little by little until you can feel that your body can handle more."
