        "Tip": "Pushups. Drop and give me 20! Pushups are one of the most basic yet effective bodyweight moves you can perform because of the number of muscles that are recruited to perform them. 1. Start in a plank position. Your core should be tight, shoulders pulled down and back, and your neck neutral. 2. Bend your elbows and begin to lower your body down to the floor. When your chest grazes it, extend your elbows and return to the start. Focus on keeping your elbows close to your body during the movement. 3. Complete 3 sets of as many reps as possible. If you can\u2019t quite perform a standard pushup with good form, drop down to a modified stance on your knees \u2014 you\u2019ll still reap many of the benefits from this exercise while building strength."
