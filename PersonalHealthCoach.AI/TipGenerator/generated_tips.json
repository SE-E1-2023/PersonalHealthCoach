        "Tip": "If you notice yourself breezing through exercising and barely breaking a sweat, focus on progressive overload by making each move more challenging by: adding 5 more reps, adding more weight, tacking on a jump to moves like squats and lunges. Another way to switch it up? Turn the routine into a time-under-tension workout, completing each move for a set amount of time instead of for a set number of reps."

        "Tip": "Broccoli provides good amounts of fiber, calcium, potassium, folate, and phytonutrients. Phytonutrients are compounds that reduce the risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers. Broccoli also provides essential antioxidants such as vitamin C and beta-carotene. In fact, a single half-cup serving of broccoli can provide around 85% of a person`s daily vitamin C value. Another compound in broccoli, called sulforaphane, may have anticancer and anti-inflammatory qualities, according to one 2019 study. However, overcooking broccoli can destroy many of its key nutrients. For this reason, it is best to eat it raw or lightly steamed."

Lie on your right side with your left leg and foot stacked on top of your right leg and foot. Prop your upper body up by placing your right forearm on the ground and elbow directly under your shoulder. 2. Contract your core to stiffen your spine and lift your hips and knees off the ground, forming a straight line with your body. 3. Return to start in a controlled manner. Repeat 3 sets of 10-15 reps on one side, then switch."
