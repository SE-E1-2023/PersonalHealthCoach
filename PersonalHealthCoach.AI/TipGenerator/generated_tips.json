        "Tip": "Understand the basics of building muscle. First, increase your caloric and complete protein intake, so your body has enough building blocks to get bigger. Then, when you enter the gym, focus on your form. Perform compound movements and train with weights on average around four times a week. Never underestimate the importance of rest. Remember, muscle tissue grows outside of the gym when you`re giving your body time to relax and recover following your workouts."

Keep your chin slightly tucked and your gaze just in front of your hands. 3. Take deep, controlled breaths while maintaining tension throughout your entire body, so your abs, shoulders, triceps, glutes, and quads are all engaged. 4. Complete 2-3 sets of 30-second holds to start."
