Begin in a pushup position with your hand and toes firmly planted on the ground, your back straight, and your core tight. 2. Keep your chin slightly tucked and your gaze just in front of your hands. 3. Take deep, controlled breaths while maintaining tension throughout your entire body, so your abs, shoulders, triceps, glutes, and quads are all engaged. 4. Complete 2-3 sets of 30-second holds to start."
