Ultra-processed foods are highly palatable, meaning they are easily overeaten, and activate reward-related regions in the brain, which can lead to excess calorie consumption and weight gain. Studies show that diets high in ultra-processed food can contribute to obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic conditions. In addition to low quality ingredients like inflammatory fats, added sugar, and refined grains, they`re usually low in fiber, protein, and micronutrients. Thus, they provide mostly empty calories.",

The most beneficial intake amount appears to be 3-4 cups per day, although pregnant people should limit or avoid it completely because it has been linked to low birth weight. However, it`s best to consume coffee and any caffeine-based items in moderation. Excessive caffeine intake may lead to health issues like insomnia and heart palpitations. To enjoy coffee in a safe and healthy way, keep your intake to less than 4 cups per day and avoid high-calorie, high-sugar additives like sweetened creamer.",

A disruption in gut bacteria is linked to some chronic diseases, including obesity and a myriad of digestive problems. Good ways to improve gut health include eating probiotic foods like yogurt and sauerkraut, taking probiotic supplements — when indicated — and eating plenty of fiber. Notably, fiber serves as a prebiotic, or a food source for your gut bacteria.",
        "Stay hydrated. Hydration is an important and often overlooked marker of health. Staying hydrated helps ensure that your body is functioning optimally and that your blood volume is sufficient. Drinking water is the best way to stay hydrated, as it`s free of calories, sugar, and additives. Although there`s no set amount that everyone needs per day, aim to drink enough so that your thirst is adequately quenched.",
        "Don`t eat heavily charred meats. Meat can be a nutritious and healthy part of your diet. It`s very high in protein and a rich source of nutrients. However, problems occur when meat is charred or burnt. This charring can lead to the formation of harmful compounds that may increase your risk for certain cancers. When you cook meat, try not to char or burn it. Additionally limit your consumption of red and processed meats like lunch meats and bacon as these are linked to overall cancer risk and colon cancer risk.",
        "Avoid bright lights before sleep. When you`re exposed to bright lights — which contain blue light wavelengths — in the evening, it may disrupt your production of the sleep hormone melatonin. Some ways to help reduce your blue light exposure is to wear blue light blocking glasses — especially if you use a computer or other digital screen for long periods of time — and to avoid digital screens for 30 minutes to an hour before going to bed. This can help your body better produce melatonin naturally as evening progresses, helping you sleep better.",
        "Take vitamin D if you`re deficient. Most people do not get enough vitamin D. While these widespread vitamin D inadequacies are not imminently harmful, maintaining adequate vitamin D levels can help to optimize your health by improving bone strength, reducing symptoms of depression, strengthening your immune system, and lowering your risk for cancer. If you do not spend a lot of time in the sunlight, your vitamin D levels may be low. If you have access, it`s a great idea to have your levels tested, so that you can correct your levels through vitamin D supplementation if necessary.",
        "Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. Vegetables and fruits are loaded with prebiotic fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, many of which have potent health effects. Studies show that people who eat more vegetables and fruits tend to live longer and have a lower risk for heart disease, obesity, and other illnesses.",
        "Eat adequate protein. Eating enough protein is vital for optimal health, as it provides the raw materials your body needs to create new cells and tissues. What`s more, this nutrient is particularly important for maintenance of a moderate body weight. High protein intake may boost your metabolic rate — or calorie burn — while making you feel full. It may also reduce cravings and your desire to snack late at night.",
        "Get moving. Doing aerobic exercise, or cardio, is one of the best things you can do for your mental and physical health. It`s particularly effective at reducing belly fat, the harmful type of fat that builds up around your organs. Reduced belly fat may lead to major improvements in your metabolic health. According to the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, we should strive for at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity each week.",
        "Don`t smoke or use drugs, and only drink in moderation. Smoking, harmful use of drugs, and alcohol abuse can all seriously negatively affect your health. If you do any of these actions, consider cutting back or quitting to help reduce your risk for chronic diseases. There are resources available online — and likely in your local community, as well — to help with this. Talk with your doctor to learn more about accessing resources.",
        "Use extra virgin olive oil. Extra virgin olive oil is one of the healthiest vegetable oils you can use. It`s loaded with heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and powerful antioxidants that have anti-inflammatory properties. Extra virgin olive oil may benefit heart health, as people who consume it have a lower risk for dying from heart attacks and strokes according to some evidence.",
        "Minimize your sugar intake. Added sugar is extremely prevalent in modern food and drinks. A high intake is linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend keeping added sugar intake below 10% of your daily calorie intake, while the World Health Organization recommends slashing added sugars to 5% or less of your daily calories for optimal health.",
        "Limit refined carbs. Not all carbs are created equal. Refined carbs have been highly processed to remove their fiber. They`re relatively low in nutrients and may harm your health when eaten in excess. Most ultra-processed foods are made from refined carbs, like processed corn, white flour, and added sugars. Studies show that a diet high in refined carbs may be linked to overeating, weight gain, and chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes and heart disease.",
        "Lift heavy weights. Strength and resistance training are some of the best forms of exercises you can do to strengthen your muscles and improve your body composition. It may also lead to important improvements in metabolic health, including improved insulin sensitivity — meaning your blood sugar levels are easier to manage — and increases in your metabolic rate, or how many calories you burn at rest. If you do not have weights, you can use your own bodyweight or resistance bands to create resistance and get a comparable workout with many of the same benefits. The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommends resistance training twice per week.",
        "Avoid artificial trans fats. Artificial trans fats are harmful, man-made fats that are strongly linked to inflammation and heart disease. Avoiding them should be much easier now that they have been completely banned in the United States and many other countries. Note that you may still encounter some foods that contain small amounts of naturally occurring trans fats, but these are not associated with the same negative effects as artificial trans fats.",
        "Use plenty of herbs and spices. There is a variety of herbs and spices at our disposal these days, more so than ever. They not only provide flavor but also may offer several health benefits as well. For example, ginger and turmeric both have potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which may help improve your overall health. Due to their powerful potential health benefits, you should aim to include a wide variety of herbs and spices in your diet.",
        "Nurture your social relationships. Social relationships — with friends, family, and loved ones you care about — are important not only for your mental well-being but also your physical health. Studies show that people who have close friends and family are healthier and live much longer than those who do not.",
        "Occasionally track your food intake. The only way to know exactly how many calories you eat is to weigh your food and use a nutrition tracker, as estimating your portion sizes and calorie intake is not unreliable. Tracking can also provide insights into your protein, fiber, and micronutrient intake. Though some studies have found a link between tracking calories and disordered eating tendencies, there is some evidence that suggests that people who track their food intake tend to be more successful at losing weight and maintaining their weight loss.",
        "Get rid of excess belly fat. Excessive abdominal fat, or visceral fat, is a uniquely harmful type of fat distribution that is linked to an increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and heart disease. For this reason, your waist size and waist-to-hip ratio may be much stronger markers of health than your weight. Cutting refined carbs, eating more protein and fiber, and reducing stress (which can reduce cortisol, a stress hormone that triggers abdominal fat deposition) are all strategies that may help you get rid of belly fat.",
        "Avoid restrictive diets. Diets are generally ineffective and rarely work well long term. In fact, past dieting is one of the strongest predictors for future weight gain. This is because overly restrictive diets actually lower your metabolic rate, or the amount of calories you burn, making it more difficult to lose weight. At the same time, they also cause alterations to your hunger and satiety hormones, which make you hungrier and may cause strong food cravings for foods high in fat, calories, and sugar. All of this is a recipe for rebound weight gain, or “yoyo`` dieting. Instead of dieting, try adopting a healthier lifestyle. Focus on nourishing your body instead of depriving it. Weight loss should follow as you transition to whole, nutritious foods — which are naturally more filling while containing fewer calories than processed foods.",
        "Eat whole eggs. Despite the constant back and forth about eggs and health, it`s a myth that eggs are bad for you because of their cholesterol content. Studies show that they have minimal effect on blood cholesterol in the majority of people, and they`re a great source of protein and nutrients, Additionally, a review involving 263,938 people found that egg intake had no association with heart disease risk.",
        "Meditate. Stress has a negative effect on your health. It can affect your blood sugar levels, food choices, susceptibility to sickness, weight, fat distribution, and more. For this reason, it`s important to find healthy ways to manage your stress. Meditation is one such way, and it has some scientific evidence to support its use for stress management and improving health. In one study involving 48 people with high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or both, researchers found that meditation helped lower LDL (bad) cholesterol and inflammation compared with the control group. Additionally, the participants in the meditation group reported improved mental and physical wellness.",
        "Limit your drinking. Alcohol has a ton of calories. It's easy to add 400 or 500 calories to your daily total with booze, and even more if you like liquor combined with sugary mixes. Some nutritionists believe the calories consumed from alcohol are particularly bad for you because when the body receives alcohol, it burns alcohol for fuel first, then burns other fuel.If you`re drinking and eating, the calories from what you are eating may be converted to fat much faster. Alcohol isn`t worth consuming for the serious athlete. It has more drawbacks than benefits.",
        "Drink water. Water is nature`s perfect thirst quencher. Drink plenty of fresh, pure water daily, including with meals. Drink about 16 fluid ounces, or two cups of water, about two hours before a workout. Sip water throughout your workout. If you`re working out in hot weather, be sure to drink more water than you think you need. Thirst is a sign that your body is slightlydehydrated. Drink to stay ahead of your thirst.",
        "Egg protein: In olden days, weight lifters and body builders cracked raw eggs into a glass of milk for a protein shake. Today that`s not recommended due to fears of salmonella contamination from raw eggs. You can eat cooked eggs. Egg whites contain plenty of protein power without the fat and cholesterol of the yolks, the yellow part in the center.",
        "To keep your body in peak condition, eating small meals frequently is considered best for athletes in training. Eating every two or three hours seems to be helpful for keeping energy levels high and providing maximum nutrients for bodybuilding.Avoid eating carbohydrates alone. Pair them with a protein or a fat to blunt the insulin surge associated with a high-carbohydrate meal. The crash afterwards can make you feel hungrier than before you ate. Protein should be your go-to snack of choice.Post-workout, protein will help your body rebuild tissue the fastest. Drink plenty of water before a workout.",
        "Protein is the go-to resource for weightlifting and serious athletes of all sports. Remember that what you put into your body builds your body. If you eat heavily processed foods, you won`t be able to build that lean, muscular look you`re going for.Instead, eat the best-quality foods you can afford, supplement with protein and drink plenty of fresh water. Avoid salt, refined sugar and alcohol. Get plenty of sleep and fresh air, and you`ll support your body as it transforms into your desired fitness level.",
        "Eat a healthy breakfast. If you exercise in the morning, get up early enough to finish breakfast at least one hour before your workout. This will give you energy and raise your blood sugar. If you don`t eat, you might feel sluggish or lightheaded when you exercise. Good breakfast options include whole-grain cereals or bread, bananas and yogurt. A cup of coffee is okay too. Emphasize carbohydrates for maximum energy.",
        "Size matters. You want to be careful not to overeat before exercise. Eat large meals at least three to four hours before exercising. Small meals should be eaten two to three hours before exercising. You can have small snacks an hour before exercising. Eating too much can leave you sluggish, and eating too little may not give you the energy to stay strong during your workout.",
        "Snack well. Most people can eat small snacks right before and during exercise. It`s important to do what feels best for you. Snacks shortly before exercising probably won`t give you an energy boost, but they can help maintain blood sugar levels and prevent distracting hunger pains. Good snack options include energy bars, yogurt, low-fat granola bars and peanut butter sandwiches.",
        "Eat after you exercise. Eating after you exercise will help your muscles recover. You`ll want to eat a meal that contains both protein and carbohydrates within two hours, if possible. Good post-workout food choices include yogurt and fruit, peanut butter sandwiches, pasta with meatballs and chicken with brown rice.",
        "Drink up. Remember to drink fluids. You need adequate fluids before, during and after exercise to help prevent dehydration. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends you drink two to three cups of water before your workout, half to one cup of water every 15 to 20 minutes during your workout and two to three cups after your workout for every pound of weight you lose during the workout.",
        "Wear Comfortable Sneakers. Your shoes should feel comfortable from the first step. Your feet swell during the day and stop in the late afternoon, so if you need sneakers, you'll want to shop when your feet are biggest. Also, make sure the shoes are a little roomy—enough to wiggle your toes, but no more than that. They should be comfy from the get-go, but they'll be even more so once you've walked or ran 20 to 40 miles in them.",
        "Pick Your Perfect Tunes. Running with music is a great way to get in a good workout groove. To pick the ultimate playlist, think about what gets you going and that you find uplifting. The best part about music during a workout is that the right music can make you feel better emotionally, help you perform better, and improve how much oxygen you take in.",
        "Know When To Weigh Yourself—And How Often. It's normal to want to weigh yourself soon after starting a new diet or fitness routine. It's best to step on the scale in the morning before eating or drinking—and before plunging into your daily activities. If you're wondering how often to weigh yourself, be sure to check your weight at a consistent time—possibly every week—for the most reliable number, and don't let yourself get too discouraged by different results since weight fluctuations are normal.",
        "Keep Your Portions in Check. When you change your diet, portion control can help with weight management. Portion control requires special attention to your current eating habits. For example, if your steak takes up more than half of your plate, you may want to consider cutting your serving of beef in half. That's because it's best to try and fill half your plate with veggies or a mixture of veggies and fresh fruit so you can get a healthy mix of proteins, fats, and carbs.",
        "Plan Your Runs Ahead of Time. When you have a 5K or 10K (or just a regular run) on your calendar, it's important to plan out what you're going to eat the morning of—something that will keep you fueled and go down easy. While everyone is different, we tend to have good luck with a high-carbohydrate breakfast such as a small bowl of oatmeal with fruit or a couple of pieces of toast with peanut butter or cream cheese. Also, eat around 200 to 250 (primarily carb) calories about 90 minutes before you warm up for your run, advised Kastor. And don't worry about nixing your caffeine fix on race day. Coffee is great for athletic performances, as it makes you sharper and may even give you extended energy.",
        "Don't Stress if You Go Beyond Your Calorie Needs. A healthy eating plan has a few characteristics. One of those characteristics is staying within your daily calorie needs when it comes to what you eat and drink. If you have a day when you consume more calories than your body needs to function, try not to stress. Keep in mind that it takes a lot of calories to gain a pound of body fat. That one off day doesn't usually result in any significant weight gain. What you do the next day and the day after is really important. Also, remember that starvation and excessive exercise are not healthy answers for an off day. If you get off track, you can set up a personal reminder (e.g., on a sticky note or mobile device) to ensure you eat more mindfully on future days. You can also consider doing some meal planning for home or when you're on the go and aim to maintain a healthy exercise schedule.",
        "Add Some Spice to Your Food. It's easy to get in a diet rut, even if you're loading up on flavorful fruits and veggies. Fortunately, having plenty of spices, fresh herbs, and citrus at your cooking beck and call can help. It's amazing what a little dash of spice, sprinkle of herbs, pinch of lemon zest, or squirt of lime juice can do to liven up a dish—and your diet.",
        "Know When To Make Changes to Your Exercise Routine. If your weight on the scale plateaus or your muscles don't feel as fatigued, it might be time to increase the intensity of your exercise. Take if you decide to change your running routine: The general rule of thumb is to up the amount of miles run, for races half-marathon length and longer, by 5 to 10% each week. You might also want to switch up your routine if you've been doing the same thing repeatedly, such as using the elliptical, cycling, or exercising with a workout DVD. While these are all great ways to work out, it's best to add some variety. You could also do a different type of exercise every time you work out or dedicate specific days or times for different exercises. That way, you can have more variety throughout your week.",
        "Relieve Those Side Stitches. You know the feeling: a sharp pain just below the rib cage that always seems to pop up when you're working out your hardest. It's called the side stitch, also medically known as exercise-related transient abdominal pain. Side stitches can be a major nuisance—especially when they keep you from completing a workout. Suggested ways to ease the ache have included actions such as: deep breathing, pushing on the area that hurts, stopping exercise. However, out of those methods, stopping a workout is the most helpful way to get relief from side stitches. You might also be able to prevent side stitches from happening in the first place. Waiting at least two to four hours to do any physical activity after consuming a lot of foods or drinks can help.",
        "Say Goodbye to Peer Pressure. Even if you've been eating healthy and exercising, it may be tough to stay on track if your partner, coworkers, or friends don't share your healthy eating habits. If your partner loves pizza, try ordering a pie that's heavy on the veggies and light on the cheese—then supplement it with a side salad. Also, instead of bringing a super sweet dessert on baked goods day at work, you could take baked pears with cinnamon or mini fruit-and-nut muffins to substitute for brownies and blondies.",
        "Savor Your Carbs. At times, you may consider cutting out your carbs to lose weight. But before adding dinner rolls and chips to your 'no' list, remember that yummy foods like brown rice, pumpernickel bread, and even potato chips contain resistant starch. This type of starch has been said to help with weight management by keeping a person feeling fuller for longer. This means you won't have to eat as much to feel satiated.",
        "Opt for Healthier Snack and Fast-food Options. It's hard to avoid that 3 p.m. stomach rumble. While eating something to hold you over until dinner is fine, some choices may be better than others. As often as possible, try to have some fruit, veggies, or snacks with a lot of protein handy. However, if you find fast food is your only option, pull up the restaurant's nutrition facts online. You can make an informed decision ahead of time about what to order. Nearly every quick-service restaurant has a relatively healthful option or two. Salads, chili, or grilled chicken are all good options.",
        "Up Your Fiber Intake. Along with protein and healthy fats, fiber is one of those nutritional elements that keeps you full and fueled all day long. If you're trying to lose weight, fiber is your best friend. For most adults, the recommended amount of fiber you should consume daily is between 21 grams to 30 grams.",
        "Work Out Consistently. Working out at the same time during the week or on the same days can have its benefits. Researchers of a 2020 review found that for people with overweight or obesity, having consistent exercise times (particularly in the morning) was associated with the experience of weight loss and the creation of exercise habits. Although it may take a lot to get into the habit of exercise, planning to workout at a set time or place can be advantageous for your health.",
        "Carbs aren`t the enemy. Carbohydrates are considered the new “enemy`` by a lot of people (right there after fats, which were blasted as bad for you not so long ago and they`re starting to get some “good press`` nowadays). They`re not. They`re actually quite good for you as long as you use them in the right way, and choose the right ones. It`s more important to monitor the amount of calories you`re consuming and ensure you`re in deficit (if you want to lose weight) or that you`re eating a hell of a lot more than you should if your objective is to gain weight/muscle). Myfitnesspal can help you do this and we`ve written about it previously.",
        "Cheat meals are important. While we don`t tend to like the notion of “cheat`` meals, we understand that the human mind will want to be naughty from time to time: that`s just the way things work. So, we do give advice on what`s the best mindset to be in, when to have cheat meals, and what you should be thinking about around the whole ethos of “cheating``. Your body is going to be negatively affected by it, but by how much is entirely up to how you treat it.",
        "Healthy fats are important. Having a healthy mind and body are important. One key area that can help with that is the consumption of healthy fats: coconut oil, avocados and omega 3 (the latter being super important and found in oily fish). Healthy fats help with focus and aid the body in a whole host of different things. But, just keep in mind that you can easily overeat them, so track how much they`re adding to your overall calorie intake for the day.",
        "Lifestyle changes are needed. You are where you are now because of the choices you made in your life. For you to move forward and progress, changes in your lifestyle need to be made. That means moving away from some of the bad habits you might have picked up and forming some new ones. This part is what many people struggle with at first. It`s easy to sit down in front of the TV at night and have a glass of wine and some junk food: when you`re on a mission to change your body shape (whether that`s fat loss or gaining muscle) changes in habitual actions are needed.",
        "Sleep heals everything. When we sleep the body is still working. You`ve probably heard about losing weight as you sleep (which isn`t misleading). The body does a multitude of different things when we`re asleep, and as long as you`re properly hydrated, have consumed the right amount of calories for your goal (and the right ratio of fats, proteins and carbs) then your body will do as you wish when you`re asleep (we`re assuming you`re working out as hard and as much as is required for your goal here). Having a great night`s sleep can also place you in a good mental mood for the day ahead and is especially important if you have a fitness training session that day too: you`ll find that you`ll be able to push further and for longer.",
        "Planning and Preparation help. When you go on holiday you have a plan: where you`ve got to be and when, who`s going with you, what you`re taking, and what you`re going to experience. Well, it`s the same when you want to make positive changes to your body. You need to plan out what you want and then prepare yourself mentally (and physically) for what you`re going to be undertaking.",
        "Understand the basics of building muscle. First, increase your caloric and complete protein intake, so your body has enough building blocks to get bigger. Then, when you enter the gym, focus on your form. Perform compound movements and train with weights on average around four times a week. Never underestimate the importance of rest. Remember, muscle tissue grows outside of the gym when you`re giving your body time to relax and recover following your workouts.",
        "Work your full range of motion. Don`t take any shortcuts. Aim for the largest range of motion you can achieve in your exercises. Your muscles will do more work per rep, and it will result in your breaking down more tissue by the end of the workout.",
        "Prepare yourself for endurance training. When it comes to training for endurance, you`ll need to be hydrated and be sure you`re eating properly because, by its very nature, this form of training is very demanding on your body. You should be doing a good mix of cardio and weight training. And, to increase your aerobic capacity, you should incorporate high-intensity interval training, or HIIT. You`ll likely be sweating buckets and burning calories galore, so be prepared.",
        "Consider reducing rest time. It`s always tempting to take a break when training, but you should stick with rest times of 30 to 45 seconds between sets, because this will help increase your overall endurance. If you are strength training, lift moderate to heavy weight and keep your rep range between 8-15 reps. If you`re running, mix low-intensity, steady-state cardio with sprinting.",
        "Learn how to fight fatigue. Fatigue may be your biggest enemy when endurance training, but there are some ways to combat it. First, drink beet juice, which is packed with healthy nitrates that can improve your cardiovascular functioning. Beets can actually increase stamina by up to 16%, and it helps your muscles produce more energy, more efficiently, making exercise less exhausting. Another way to boost your performance is by carefully selecting your music. When people listen to favorable music their blood vessels expanded 26%.",
        "Find your motivation. Motivation is key. Some good ways to stay motivated while you're working out: Count down, not up, when performing reps. Another trick: Look at your dominant hand while you`re pushing up. That automatically includes a positive reinforcement because the dominant hand more easily and quickly moves the weight.",
        "Take photographic evidence. Can`t get the scale to budge? It`s possible you`re gaining muscle and shedding body fat—and that means your net weight change will seem stuck, even though you're making progress. Take pictures on a weekly basis—front, back, (and) side pictures all from the same angle, same lighting, same clothing. That way, you'll see change over time, even though it may not look like it day to day.",
        "Attack your lower body to burn fat. To flatten your belly, go below your navel. In a Syracuse University study, people burned more calories the day after they did a lower-body resistance training exercise than after they worked their upper bodies, simply because legs have more mass.",
        " Find exercise you enjoy. This is important when it comes to staying consistent with your workouts. If you are continually doing exercises you don't enjoy, and they leave you feeling drained physically and emotionally, it`s only going to last so long. You are better off finding exercises that make you feel good, and you can stick to long term, even if it's not the most intense. Consistent low-intensity exercise will always triumph inconsistent high-intensity exercise.",
        "Be patient when it comes to reaching your physical goals. Remember, results take time. Be easy on yourself. Nothing good comes easy. Learn to fall in love with the process and the person you become throughout the journey.",

        "Try new things. Step out of your comfort zone. Try a new fitness class with a friend and explore different foods. Grocery shopping based on what's in season is an easy way to begin experimenting with different foods and exposing yourself to a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. If you have never meal prepped before, try it out! Stepping out of your comfort zone and switching things up will keep things interesting and help you stay motivated and inspired to make this way of living a permanent lifestyle.",
        "Try the 80/20 rule. A happy couple eating cookies in the living room Overindulgence is not good for health, but so is over limiting your foods. There are so many amazing foods out there. Give yourself a break by following the 80/20 rule. This diet plan allows you to indulge - but only 20% of the time! Meaning, you will follow a well-balanced diet 80% of the time (six days a week). During that one “cheat`` day, you can treat yourself to foods you like but may not be necessarily healthy - such as cookies, cakes, ice cream, or chips. This allows for balance, fun, and variety in your diet. It also encourages you to focus on the “big picture`` plan of eating healthy while also offering flexibility when you need it."

Eggs are also a good source of the essential amino acid leucine, which plays a role in stimulating muscle protein synthesis. Eggs also provide a good amount of choline, which is important for cell membranes. The yolk contains most of the egg`s vitamins and minerals, as well as the fat and cholesterol. However, one 2017 review found that eating up to seven eggs per week does not increase the risk of heart disease. That said, the authors mention that people with cardiovascular disease or diabetes should seek medical consultation about including eggs in the diet. Indeed, one study found higher rates of cardiovascular disease in people who consumed more cholesterol from eggs.

It raises your stress levels and eventually impacts your physical health. Since you`re not yet completely healed, you need to be patient and positive towards the journey. Be realistic with your body`s capabilities. Monitor its progress closely and don`t head straight to perform heavy activities. If you have worries, talk it out with a friend or a health expert.

As we briefly mentioned, you can discuss your worries with someone who can help you, or you can trust. In addition, everyone understands that when someone is recovering, assistance is highly needed. Don`t be shy to ask for help even with the smallest things, such as getting a glass of water, taking a shower, changing clothes, or setting daily reminders to take prescribed medicine.",

            "Don`t push your workouts too far. Entering back into an intense exercise routine when you`re not yet back to 100% after illness is a big mistake. The key is to build up gradually. Exercising lighter, but more regularly is always a good starting point. Try walking for 10 continuous minutes, three times a day and build your way up to 30 minutes of consecutive walking, daily.",

A useful rule to follow is if your symptoms are above the neck (runny nose, headache or a sore throat), then you are generally OK to work out but stick to moderate exercise and avoid overdoing it - for example, try power walking instead of running. If your symptoms are below the neck (coughing, stomach pain, aching or a fever) you should avoid working out and make sure you get plenty of rest to allow your body to recover. It`s worth being mindful that if you go to a busy gym with a cold, you`re likely to pass germs on to people through the air and using the equipment.`` The tube is one thing; the treadmill, quite another.

        "Recover from Injury":[
            "GET LOOSE AND STRETCH. Depending on the severity of your injury, you might have to wait for a little before getting back onto your regular training routine. Some injuries, like torn or pulled muscles, should not be stretched. Doing so will only worsen the injury. Under the approval of your doctor, you may be able to practice some light exercise and stretching. Stretching can help condition your muscles while also helping prevent future injuries.  At X Shadyside, we offer a movement-based class called StretchX. This class challenges your range of motion and flexibility.",

            "STAY HYDRATED. Staying hydrated is crucial for injury prevention and healing. Water is your best source of replenishment. Proper hydration plays an important role in the healing process. Drinking water can help speed up your recovery by thinning your blood, thereby allowing nutrients and oxygen to flow quickly through your body. You will also want to avoid caffeinated drinks, as they can make it difficult for the body to reduce swelling.",

            "REMEMBER TO FOCUS ON YOUR MENTAL RECOVERY TOO. Physical injuries can negatively affect one’s mental health. It’s common for people to feel frustrated, angry, or isolated after experiencing an injury. Some athletes even experience depression or anxiety. That’s why it’s important to look after your mental health during your recovery. Some people seek out emotional support or make temporary lifestyle changes to keep themselves occupied. Setting new goals can also help you stay positive and make a successful recovery.",

            "PRACTICE COLD THERAPY. Don’t forget to Rest, Ice, Compress, and Elevate! This can help reduce pain and prevent swelling. If you experienced an acute soft tissue injury, you will need to follow the RICE method immediately. This cold therapy method can alleviate any discomfort resulting from the injury. The full steps of the RICE treatment include: R for Rest: Avoid moving or using the injured body part for at least a few hours, I for Ice: Apply an ice pack to your injury to help reduce pain and swelling, C for Compress: Firmly wrap a bandage around the injury and E for Elevate: Elevate the injury above your heart or at least close to its level if you can’t elevate it",

            "REST. In general, you should wait one to three days before working out. However, this will vary based on the severity of your injury and your doctor’s recommendation. During this rest period, you can think about what factors led to your injury. Were you pushing yourself too hard? Failing to properly warm-up? Using poor technique? Thinking about this can help you take the necessary steps to prevent the same injury from occurring again. Sometimes, injuries occur as a result of a freak accident. But other times, you can learn something important from your injury.",

            "FOLLOW PRACTICES FOR INJURY PREVENTION. While some injuries are not 100% preventable, you can still follow best practices for injury prevention to significantly reduce your chances of dealing with one. Maybe you need to stretch longer or perform more warm-up exercises. Or you’re pushing yourself too hard. If you’re having trouble following a challenging, but safe routine, you might benefit from hiring a personal trainer for assistance.",

            "NOURISH YOURSELF ON A HEALTHY DIET. Your diet can have a large impact on your healing process. During your recovery, make sure you fill yourself up with plenty of protein! Protein is essential for muscle development, which will be essential when you start re-training. Vitamin C and omega-3 fatty-acids are also great for healing, as they contain numerous anti-inflammatory properties. You should also seek out foods that are rich in zinc, calcium, and fiber. All of these nutrients play important roles in the healing process.",

            "Allow healing of the injured body part. An injured body part will struggle to heal if it is repeatedly used after an injury. Pain is an excellent indicator of an ongoing injury and should not be ignored, even if that means resting from daily functional activities or sports. It is often best to immobilise the injured area with a splint or brace and rest it completely to allow complete healing. Continuing to use the injured body part may aggravate an acute injury and turn it into a chronic one, making it more likely to recur and more difficult to treat.",

            "Get a diagnosis and understand your injury. Minor sprains or tears typically improve significantly after 2 weeks of rest and a break from sport. A lack of improvement should warrant a consultation with a sports doctor. A thorough clinical examination and imaging tests such as x-rays or scans will confirm the diagnosis and help focus the rehabilitation strategy to enable a faster recovery with limited complications. Understanding the nature of the injury also helps enormously with the mental preparation during recovery.",

            "Early range of motion exercises. Once the initial inflammation has settled, early movements of the joint to restore a full range of movement is critical. This exercise regime is best implemented under the supervision of a specialist or physiotherapist who will ensure the appropriate milestones are achieved. A premature return to sport while joint motion is still limited can increase your risk for further injury.",

            "Regaining a normal walking pattern and muscle strength. A normal walking pattern means that there is a normal weight transfer from the feet to the knee, hip and back. An abnormal walking pattern could be due to pain, weakness or muscle imbalance, and must be addressed before returning to sports. A period of rest and disuse typically results in muscle wasting, sometimes even in uninjured body parts. A key component of muscle strengthening is resistance training which improves balance, reflex control and endurance in the injured tissues. This is often implemented along with conditioning and endurance training to prepare the injured area for a faster return to sports.",

            "CRITICAL ORIGINAL INJURY STAGE. When your injury first takes place, your initial response can have a drastic impact on your overall recovery outlook. For any injury that does not require an instant visit to the emergency room, there will always be a period of time before you meet and strategize with a physical therapist or doctor. That means that you have to be extremely cautious right after the injury occurs. It can be easy to worsen your condition, even with common daily tasks. When you are first injured, something as simple as turning a steering wheel or walking up stairs could further strain a shoulder or leg injury.",

            "The second half of the fail-safe RICE method involves compression and elevation. Like step number 2, you should compress and elevate the injury the same day it occurs, or immediately if possible. Remember to not wrap the injury too tight when applying compression. If you are applying elevation to the injured area of your body, aim to raise the body part above your heart.",

            "LIGHT ACTIVITY/EXERCISING. If you are still at the stage where you are attempting to self-diagnose the severity of your recent injury, this can be a great step to lightly test the affected area. Make sure to never try your regular workout regiment. Light walks for lower body or the use of very minimal weight for upper body lifts are ideal. Remember, if you ever feel discomfort similar to your original injury, or unusual pain of any type, stop the exercise immediately.",
            
            "EVERY CASE IS DIFFERENT. There are so many factors that vary with each person’s body that could affect injury recovery and progression. Every case is truly different. That’s why you need a physical therapist to help guide you. The body is too complicated for the average person to understand, and you need guidance to be absolutely sure your injury is healing correctly.",
            
            "BALANCE OF INJURY RECOVERY VS. EXERCISE. This can be one of the trickiest steps to execute within the injury recovery process. It’s important to stay in shape, but not at the expense of your injury recovery. Once you have received a diagnosis from your physical therapist or doctor, you will need to strictly follow their guidance for day-to-day activity. For some injuries, this may mean no exercise at all for a designated period. Do not ever try to work your way back from an injury through increased exercise.",
            
            "BEWARE OF SETBACKS. Recovering from an injury in many cases can be very difficult. There is potential for setbacks. It can be fairly easy to tweak an injury and worsen your condition. Even if it has begun to improve. If rehabilitation has stalled, take further measures, and seek more treatment from a doctor. Don’t wait to take action or the condition could worsen.",
            
            "REGAINING STRENGTH. After you have seen a doctor and received further consultation, a physical therapist can still be extremely helpful afterward as well. Again, remember to stay in constant contact with either a doctor or a physical therapist and keep them updated on your condition. Even when the arrow is pointing up in your recovery and your injury is improving, this is still a critical time where you are more likely to reinjure yourself than when you are completely healthy. Make sure you continue to take it slow in all areas of your life (workouts, or just in general) until you are completely cleared by a doctor.",
            
            "RETURN TO FULL HEALTH. You made it! There are a few signs to make sure you are completely healed and ready for anything. First off, obviously, you should not be feeling pain from the injury anymore, and swelling should be gone. Also, make sure you have regained a full range of motion in the injured area.",
            
            "FUTURE INJURY PREVENTION. Now that you have fully recovered from your injury, what’s next? Well, now you can execute a few preventative habits to decrease the chances you are injured in the future. This is a huge final step after your injury because it can help guide you throughout the rest of your life to avoid deterioration of your body due to injury in the future. How you work out or how you respond to minor nicks and bruises can have a huge impact on your future injury outlook.",

            "Immobilize The Injured Part Of The Body. If an injured body part is frequently utilized after an accident, it will have a difficult time healing. Pain is a good sign of a continuing injury, and it should not be disregarded, even if it means taking a break from everyday activities or sports. To facilitate full healing, it is generally essential to immobilize the damaged region using a splint or brace and rest it entirely. Continuing to utilize the damaged body part may exacerbate an acute injury, making it more likely to reoccur and more difficult to cure.",
            
            "Physical Therapy. The first step after the acute inflammation has gone down is to regain a complete range of motion. To do this, follow an exercise program under the supervision of either a professional or physical therapist who will make sure that you are meeting milestones along the way and not returning too soon when joint mobility is still restricted—this could lead to additional injury."

The belts are made from PVC, a porous plastic that is hospitable to germs, yeast and mold. If you're putting unwrapped produce on the belt, you could bring some of that illness-causing funk home with you. Put all your produce in plastic bags as you select it. When you get home, thoroughly wash anything you'll consume.",
        
        "You're Not Washing Your Hands Enough. The No. 1 tip doctors gave us for staying healthy during cold and flu season, and during this coronavirus crisis? Wash your hands often and well. Unfortunately, not enough of us do — even after using a public restroom. A CDC study found that only 31% of men and 65% of women wash their hands after using a public toilet. Always wash your hands with soap and water for the recommended length of time (read on for what that is). Carry alcohol-based hand sanitizer as backup.",
        
        "You're Not Washing Your Hands Long Enough. It's not just remembering to wash your hands that's important—it's key to wash them long enough to properly remove bacteria. A recent USDA study found that 97 percent of us — 97 percent! — don't wash our hands correctly. The most common mistake? Not washing them long enough. Wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds, about long enough to sing \"Happy Birthday\" twice. Dry them thoroughly.",
        
        "You Have Poor Posture. Do you have an aching back? Poor posture could be responsible. But there are easy things you can do to prevent the chronic aggravation. Back pain, specifically low back pain, can be caused by poor posture and weak abdominal muscles. Those areas need to be targeted and strengthened to relieve the pain and prevent future flare-ups.",
        
        "You're Commuting on Public Transportation. A recent study found that people who commute to work via bus or subway are six-and-a-half times more likely to contract acute respiratory infections than if people who walk or drive — just because those environments expose you to many more people and their germs. You can catch COVID-19 there, too. No portable plastic bubble necessary here. Most colds and flu are caused by transferring germs from your hands to your eyes, nose or mouth. So wear a face mask, wash your hands or use a generous squirt of hand sanitizer after you exit public transportation.",
        
        "You're Using Antibacterial Hand Soap. Antibacterial hand soap was once considered a valuable tool in the fight against illnesses like colds and flu. Now we know it's a health underminer: The antibacterial chemicals in those soaps are contributing to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. And they're no better at removing germs from your hands than regular, old-fashioned soap. Replace antibacterial soaps with regular, and wash your hands frequently to prevent the spread of disease-causing germs.",
        
        "You're Ignoring Vitamin D. Although the jury is out on the effectiveness of multivitamins, there's one vitamin you shouldn't overlook: Vitamin D. Multiple studies have found that maintaining an adequate Vitamin D level may be protective against several types of cancer — and guard against everyday colds and flu too. But because the body mainly produces D when the skin is exposed to the sun, it's easy to become deficient. Fully half of us have a low vitamin D level, the National Institutes of Health says. According to the NIH's Office of Dietary Supplements, adults should get 600 IU of vitamin D daily, and 800 IU after the age of 70. Your doctor can check your vitamin D level with a simple blood test.",
        
        "You're Not Cleaning Your Bathroom Sink Frequently. The toilet seat isn't the germiest place in your bathroom. It's the sink. According to a study by the Public Health and Safety Organization, the bathroom faucet handle is the sixth-germiest site in the average house. (The toilet doesn't even hit the top 10.) Dampness and frequency of use make it a breeding ground for creepy-crawlies. Wash your hands every time you use the bathroom, and thoroughly clean your bathroom sink once a week.",
        
        "You're Doing a Juice Cleanse. After a period of overindulgence, you might be tempted to go on a detox diet or juice cleanse. Resist! In many cases, people are referring to some type of extremely restrictive low-calorie diet for an extended period of time—days or even weeks. A juice cleanse doesn't cleanse your body in any way. It can reduce your calories dramatically, but that will simply put your body in starvation mode that will slow your metabolism in response.",

Well, one woman sued the makeup chain Sephora in 2017, claiming she contracted oral herpes from a lipstick tester. And a 2005 study found between 67 and 100 percent of makeup-counter testers were contaminated with bacteria, including E. coli, staph and strep. All those bugs can cause skin and eye infections. Never use a public makeup tester. Ask for a single-use sample that's sealed. If those aren't available, test a new shade on the back of your hand, then wash it off promptly.",

Washing raw chicken before cooking it is a still-common practice that can be a serious hazard to your health. It can splash campylobacter or salmonella bacteria into the surrounding area—the faucet, sponges, dish towels and kitchen tools—which you can then transfer to your hands, mouth or other food. Never wash raw chicken.",

Researchers at the University of Toronto examined 70 years of studies and found that dog ownership was associated with a 24 percent reduced risk of death from any cause. And four-legged friends seem to be particularly good for the heart: People who owned dogs had a 31 percent lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 65 percent lower chance of dying after having a heart attack. Why? Dogs require people to be more active, and may reduce feelings of loneliness, which scientists say can stress the heart.",

People who reported poor social relationships had a 29 percent higher risk of coronary disease, and a 32 percent higher risk of stroke, than those with robust friendships. Why? Researchers believe loneliness increases chronic stress, a risk factor for heart disease. Develop hobbies. Take time to call or text with friends or family. If you're feeling socially isolated or depressed, talk to your doctor about the best course of action.",

The blue light emitted by computers, smartphones and TVs disturbs your natural circadian rhythm, which can lead to insomnia. Poor sleep has been correlated with serious illnesses like cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Turn off TV, phones, computers and tablets at least 60 minutes before lights-out. For the best night's sleep, consider pretending that you live in an earlier time. Wind down by reading a (paper) book, writing in a journal, or chatting with your partner.",

You might have heard the expression \"sitting is the new smoking\"? The jury is still out on that, but the science is clear that sitting is not a health regimen: A 2017 study at the University of Warwick found that workers with desk jobs had bigger waists and a higher risk of heart disease than those with more active jobs. What's more, workers' bad (LDL) cholesterol increased and good (HDL) cholesterol decreased with each hour beyond five hours of sitting a day.

Java is packed with antioxidants, which protect your heart and liver and guard against diabetes and cancer. Moderate coffee consumption (three to four cups per day) has been linked with longer lifespan. In fact, a November 2015 study in Circulation found that coffee consumption was associated with an 8% to 15% reduction in the risk of death, with larger reductions among those with higher coffee consumption.

The pelvic floor muscles can be weakened from pregnancy, childbirth, being overweight, aging, or even straining from constipation. When these muscles are weak, incontinence and erectile difficulties can occur. Both men and women can benefit from doing pelvic floor exercises daily.

The low-fat craze of the 1980s has yet to fully abate, even after \"low-fat\" processed foods were revealed to the ultimate dietary Trojan horse: When manufacturers took out the fat, they often replaced it with added sugar and carbs that fail to fill you up, making you ultimately consume more calories. Fat, consumed in proper amounts, doesn't make you fat. Too many calories make you fat, and low-fat foods may just leave you hungry. Come home from your next shopping trip with satiating \"good\" fats, fatty fish, olive oil, nuts and avocados.",

Multiple studies show that omega-3s—which are found in fish like salmon, leafy green vegetables, nuts and flaxseeds—have been shown to decrease the risk of heart attack and stroke, support eye and brain health, improve mood and ease arthritis. Researchers believe omega-3s work to quell inflammation throughout the body. Eat fish like salmon once or twice a week, the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health advises. Choose wild-caught fish, not farmed. Grill, pan-roast or steam it; don't fry or sauté. Pile on the leafy green vegetables, and snack on nuts. (Just don't take a shortcut by popping a supplement; research suggests they may not be effective.)",

Your eyes can harbor signs of various chronic diseases, which a trained eye doctor can spot, enabling you to get early treatment. There are certain eye conditions like glaucoma which are considered to be 'silent killers' of vision. Additionally, an eye care provider can detect bleeding and swelling of the retina, the lining inside of the eye, as it relates to diabetes, hypertension and other systemic diseases.

It might be harder to get to sleep and stay asleep as we age—some people experience a shift in natural circadian rhythms—but that doesn't mean it's healthy. Without adequate sleep, your body can't adequately repair and recharge. That increases your risk of cancer, heart disease and dementia. If you're having chronic trouble getting seven to nine hours of sleep a night, talk to your doctor. He or she might advise cutting back on caffeine, limiting naps, getting more exercise or addressing anxiety or depression. In some cases, a sleep medicine specialist can be helpful.",

Heartburn, or acid reflux—in which stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, causing burning or pain the chest or throat—has a starring role in a number of commercials for over-the-counter medications. But if you experience heartburn regularly, it's not a good idea to keep popping antacids. It could be a medical condition that needs a doctor's attention. Over time, stomach acid can damage the sensitive tissue of the esophagus, leading to a precancerous condition called Barrett's esophagus. That could develop into esophageal cancer, a particularly deadly form of the disease. If you suffer from regular heartburn, talk to your doctor about it. He or she might recommend a prescription, lifestyle changes or further testing.",

If you're sexually active and nonmonogamous, routine screening should be part of your health care strategy. Many STIs are silent, and without screening you may be causing permanent damage to your body. Even if you get checked every now and then, are you getting all the right parts checked? Screening is recommended for extra-genital sites where exposure has occurred, because the infections can be very subtle in these places.

Regular dental visits can prevent the huge costs — both physical and financial—that accompany tooth loss. As we age, regular wear-and-tear can lead to cracking, cavities, plaque buildup and receding gums, which can set us on the path to dentures or implants. That's what your dentist is there to prevent.

Blood pressure that's too high (a.k.a. hypertension) can weaken the walls of blood vessels, increasing your risk of stroke, heart attack and dementia. In 2018, the American Heart Association lowered the guidelines for healthy blood pressure from 140/90 (and 150/80 for those older than 65) to 130/80 for all adults. According to Harvard Medical School, that means 70 to 79 percent of men over 55 technically have hypertension. Experts say you should get your blood pressure checked annually.

Frequent snoring could be the sign of a dangerous condition called sleep apnea, in which the airway behind the tongue collapses when you breathe in, reducing or even stopping your airflow for up to a minute. Sleep apnea has been associated with high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, according to the National Sleep Foundation. Researchers think that's because the condition causes repeated oxygen deprivation that stresses the blood vessels and heart. If your partner has told you that you snore, ask your doctor about it. They may refer you to a sleep medicine specialist.",

But according to the National Stroke Association, up to 80 percent of them are preventable. That's because the processes that lead to stroke—in which a blood vessel in the brain is blocked or bursts, leading to neurological damage or paralysis—are heavily influenced by lifestyle choices like diet and smoking. Keep your blood pressure and weight in a healthy range. If you have high cholesterol, diabetes or AFib, get them treated—all are risk factors for stroke.

But some of the process may be beyond your control. Genetics can play a role in cholesterol level, and so does aging: Our bodies produce more of the artery-clogging stuff as we mature. Your total cholesterol level should be less than 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), with an LDL level of less than 100 mg/dL and an HDL level of 60 mg/dL or higher. Experts recommend getting a cholesterol check every five years; older adults may need it done more frequently.

It may be more than you think: Experts say women should have no more than one alcoholic beverage per day, and men should limit themselves to two. Any more than that, and you're putting yourself at risk for cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes and more than a dozen forms of cancer. If you're drinking more than that on a regular basis, talk to your doctor.",
        
        "You're Not Treating Signs of Depression. For generations, Americans viewed mental health as somewhat of a bonus—something to be concerned about only after all other aspects of your life were attended to. Today, we know that's wrongheaded: Many studies have shown that mental health has a direct correlation to serious physical illness. If you find yourself with a persistent low mood, frequent feelings of hopelessness, or a lack of interest in things you used to enjoy, you could be suffering from depression. Untreated, it could raise your risk of heart disease and other chronic conditions. Talk to your doctor. Many treatments are available.",

Chances are, probably not: Studies show that most Americans consume about 3,400mg of sodium daily — way over the recommended 2,300mg (which amounts to about one teaspoon of salt). High sodium intake is a major risk factor for high blood pressure, which raises your chance of having a heart attack. Don't add salt to your meals. Limit your consumption of fast food and processed foods, which tend to come loaded with sodium. Look at nutrition facts labels: One can of a popular tomato juice brand packs almost 1,000 mg! Opt for lower-sodium version when possible.",
        
        "You're Skipping An Annual Mammogram After Age 45. There's a lot of dialogue and confusion about preventative testing and self-examinations, particularly when it comes to breast health. The facts: The risk of developing breast cancer increases as women age. By age 40, that risk is 3.5 times higher than it was at age 30. The American Cancer Society recommends that women age 40 to 44 get annual breast cancer screening if they choose. From age 45 to 54, women should get an annual mammogram. After age 55, women can switch to mammograms every two years or can continue with annual screening if they wish.",

But experts have pinpointed a new enemy: \"Ultra-processed food.\" Two new studies published in the journal BMJ link highly processed food consumption with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and an increased risk of early death. It's been correlated to higher rates of obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol—all risk factors for a heart attack and other health problems. What counts as \"ultra-processed\"? The researchers listed sausages, mayonnaise, potato chips, pizza, cookies, chocolates and candies, artificially sweetened beverages and whisky, gin and rum,among other things. Limit the proportion of processed food in your diet. Ground your diet in fruits and vegetables, lean protein and good fats.",

It's an easy habit to make fun of—we're thinking about that joke in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt about people who bring a bottle of water so they can hydrate on the way to the water store, but these are the facts: Our bodies need water so our organs and body processes can function optimally. And as we get older, it gets easier to slip into dehydration. Experts recommend drinking 1.7 liters (or 7 cups) of water every 24 hours.",
        
        "You're Overweight. Slimming down can really beef up your lifespan. Carrying extra pounds contributes to a variety of health problems, including heart disease, diabetes and stroke. Studies show that overweight people who lose even a little weight (such as 5 to 10 percent of their total body weight) reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease. Know your healthy weight range. Eat a plant-heavy diet, reduce your consumption of empty calories and processed foods and get regular exercise.",
        
        "You're Not Getting Annual Skin Cancer Checks. Melanoma, the deadliest skin cancer, is relatively rare—it amounts to only about 1 percent of all cancers—but the number of cases has been rising for the last 30 years. When melanoma is caught early, the five-year survival rate is high, but that drops off dramatically once it spreads. Additionally, melanoma can form on parts of the body that are out of your line of sight, like on your back or scalp. That's why it's important to get a periodic skin cancer exam. Talk to your primary-care doctor, who may provide a referral to a dermatologist for an all-over check. You should get one annually.",
        
        "You're Not Following Colon Cancer Screening Recommendations. What's the primary risk factor for colon cancer? It's not diet or exercise, although those play a serious role. It's simply age: Your risk of the disease rises significantly after age 50. When detected early (as localized polyps), colon cancer is one of the easiest forms of cancer to cure. How to do that? The American Cancer Society recommends that you get your first colonoscopy at age 45, and repeat it every 10 years. Your doctor may have different recommendations based on your family background and personal medical history. Get that first colonoscopy, if you haven't already, and follow your doctor's advice for follow-up procedures.",
        
        "You're Self-Diagnosing on the Internet. This is a top gripe of many doctors and health experts, who say you might be second-guessing yourself out of good care. Letting the Internet guide your decisions may delay a correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Engaging your physician is essential to an accurate diagnosis that may be life saving. Do your research, but leave the diagnosing to the experts.",
        
        "You're Smoking. You know it's a major contributor to lung cancer—so much so, it's responsible for up to 80 percent of deaths from that disease. Additionally, smoking raises your risk for strokes and heart attacks—the toxins in cigarette smoke damage and weaken blood vessels, which can cause them to burst or accumulate sticky plaque that can lead to a heart attack. That's why cigarette smoking is the No. 1 preventable cause of death. Quit smoking ASAP. See your doctor for help. It's never too late: Even people who quit smoking between the ages of 65 to 69 can add one to four years to their lives."
